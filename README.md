# Shoe-Size-Predictor-1st-ML-project-
A very basic Machine Learning project using the OLS model used to predict someone's shoe size based on their height and gender. First attempt at Machine Learning using Microsoft Learn's module. (Note: relatively small dataset used, so expect inaccuracies)

The code for creation of the model is in model.py. Includes visual representation using matplotlib.
Run shoe_size_guesser.py to see a basic terminal based guesser application for the model.

Dataset obtained from: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/JA9DW
