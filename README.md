# Shoe-Size-Predictor-1st-ML-project-
A very basic Machine Learning project using the OLS model used to predict someone's shoe size based on their height and gender. First attempt at Machine Learning using Microsoft Learn's module. (Note: relatively small dataset used, so expect inaccuracies)

Dataset obtained from: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/JA9DW
